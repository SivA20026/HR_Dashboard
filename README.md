As an HR enthusiast, I leveraged Power BI to create a comprehensive HR Manager Dashboard that integrates data from Kaggle. This dashboard provides a holistic view of key HR metrics including active employees, turnover rates, recruitment metrics, and employee ages, Average wages etc.
**The implementation of this dashboard has significantly improved the HR teamâ€™s ability to track and analyse these metrics, leading to more data-driven decision making and a reduction in time spent on manual data.**
